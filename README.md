<b> Experiment|     <b> To Find The Flow of Flow Using a V Notch

### About the Experiment 
This experiment determines the flow rate of water using a V-notch weir, a triangular-shaped notch that allows water to flow through. The height of water above the notch (head) is measured and used in a standard discharge formula to calculate the theoretical flow rate. By comparing it with the actual collected water over time, the accuracy of the V-notch method can be analyzed. It demonstrates principles of fluid mechanics in open channel flow measurement.
