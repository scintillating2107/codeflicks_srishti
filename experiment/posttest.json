    {
      "question": "Why is a V-notch considered more sensitive at low flow rates compared to other notches?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It has a larger opening",
        "b": "The flow area increases rapidly with head",
        "c": "It reduces the velocity of flow",
        "d": "It is easier to manufacture"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – a larger opening doesn't guarantee better sensitivity.",
        "b": "Correct – the V-notch's triangular shape causes a rapid increase in flow area as head increases. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weir_(water)'>Learn more</a>",
        "c": "Incorrect – the V-notch does not primarily function by reducing velocity.",
        "d": "Incorrect – manufacturing ease isn't related to flow sensitivity."

    {
      "question": "What does the angle θ represent in the V-notch discharge formula?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Width of the notch",
        "b": "Water surface slope",
        "c": "Angle of the V-notch",
        "d": "Height of the fluid"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – θ is not the width.",
        "b": "Incorrect – it has nothing to do with surface slope.",
        "c": "Correct – θ is the angle of the V-notch opening. <a href='https://www.engineeringenotes.com/hydraulic-machines/weirs/v-notch-weir-and-its-formula-hydraulic-machines/40782'>Reference</a>",
        "d": "Incorrect – height is represented by H."

    {
      "question": "What happens to the flow rate if the head over a 90° V-notch doubles?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It doubles",
        "b": "It triples",
        "c": "It increases more than double",
        "d": "It stays the same"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – flow rate increases nonlinearly with head.",
        "b": "Incorrect – it increases more than triple.",
        "c": "Correct – because Q ∝ H^(5/2), doubling H increases Q by more than double. <a href='https://nptel.ac.in/content/storage2/courses/105103021/module5/lecture4/lecture4.pdf'>Proof here</a>",
        "d": "Incorrect – flow rate definitely changes with head."

      "question": "Which property of water directly affects the theoretical discharge through a V-notch?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Temperature",
        "b": "Surface tension",
        "c": "Density",
        "d": "Color"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Partially relevant but not direct in the formula.",
        "b": "Not included in standard discharge calculations.",
        "c": "Correct – density influences flow due to its role in gravitational potential energy. <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/weir-flow'>Reference</a>",
        "d": "Incorrect – color has no effect."

    {
      "question": "What happens to the coefficient of discharge (Cd) if energy losses around the V-notch increase?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It increases",
        "b": "It decreases",
        "c": "It becomes zero",
        "d": "It remains unchanged"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – losses reduce efficiency.",
        "b": "Correct – more losses mean actual discharge is less, lowering Cd. <a href='https://www.civilwala.com/weir-types-formula/'>Explore more</a>",
        "c": "Incorrect – it won’t drop to zero unless there's no flow.",
        "d": "Incorrect – Cd changes with flow conditions."
