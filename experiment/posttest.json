    {
      "question": "After performing the V-notch experiment, what is the most likely reason the actual discharge is less than the theoretical discharge?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The notch was too wide",
        "b": "Water was too cold",
        "c": "Energy losses due to friction and turbulence",
        "d": "Incorrect stopwatch reading"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – notch width affects flow but doesn't explain lower discharge directly.",
        "b": "Incorrect – temperature has a minor effect under standard conditions.",
        "c": "Correct – real fluid losses reduce actual discharge. <a href='https://nptel.ac.in/courses/105103021'>Learn more</a>",
        "d": "Incorrect – it affects time, not discharge directly."

      "question": "Which measurement most directly impacts the accuracy of the calculated discharge in a V-notch experiment?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Time",
        "b": "Angle of the notch",
        "c": "Head (H) above the notch",
        "d": "Notch thickness"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – time matters for volume collection but not as critical as head.",
        "b": "Important, but typically fixed.",
        "c": "Correct – small errors in H cause large errors in Q since Q ∝ H^5/2. <a href='https://www.engineeringenotes.com/hydraulic-machines/weirs/v-notch-weir-and-its-formula-hydraulic-machines/40782'>Reference</a>",
        "d": "Incorrect – not the primary influence."

      "question": "What is typically plotted to verify the discharge relationship in the V-notch experiment?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Q vs H^0.5",
        "b": "H vs time",
        "c": "Q vs H",
        "d": "Q vs H^2.5"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – this is for orifice-type flow.",
        "b": "Incorrect – not used to verify discharge relationship.",
        "c": "Acceptable, but not linear for V-notch verification.",
        "d": "Correct – Q ∝ H^(5/2) in V-notch theory. <a href='https://www.civilwala.com/weir-types-formula/'>Reference</a>"

    {
      "question": "How is the coefficient of discharge (Cd) determined experimentally in this setup?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By measuring pressure at the notch",
        "b": "By comparing actual and theoretical discharge",
        "c": "By calculating velocity head",
        "d": "By checking water temperature"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – pressure is not directly used.",
        "b": "Correct – Cd = Q_actual / Q_theoretical. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weir_(water)'>Learn more</a>",
        "c": "Part of theory, but not enough alone.",
        "d": "Incorrect – temperature doesn’t determine Cd."

    {
      "question": "If a graph of Q vs H^2.5 is a straight line, what does it indicate?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Measurement error in head",
        "b": "Incorrect formula used",
        "c": "The experimental data follows theoretical prediction",
        "d": "Water flow was unsteady"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – straight line indicates correctness.",
        "b": "Incorrect – the formula is validated by the straight line.",
        "c": "Correct – linearity confirms Q ∝ H^2.5 relationship.",
        "d": "Incorrect – unsteady flow would create a scatter plot."
