~~ V-Notch Weir:



A V-notch weir is a triangular-shaped notch used to measure the flow of water in open channels. It is preferred for small discharge measurements because of its high sensitivity to small changes in flow.




~~ Flow Equation:

The theoretical discharge 
𝑄 over a V-notch is given by:

Where:

𝑄 = Discharge (m³/s)

𝐶𝑑 = Discharge coefficient (dimensionless)

𝑔 = Acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²)

𝜃 = Angle of the notch (usually 90°)

𝐻 = Head of water above the notch apex (m)

For a 90° V-notch, the formula simplifies to:

Q = 1.38*Cd*H^5/2


 
~~ Discharge Coefficient 
(
𝐶𝑑
):
Accounts for energy losses and non-ideal flow behavior

Typically ranges from 0.58 to 0.62 for a 90° V-notch

Can be determined experimentally by comparing actual and theoretical discharge



~~ Head Measurement (H):

Measured vertically from the apex of the notch to the free water surface

Should be taken away from the notch (at least 4H upstream) to avoid surface disturbances
