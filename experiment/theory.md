What is a V-Notch Weir?
A V-notch weir (also called a triangular notch) is a device used to measure the flow rate of liquid, typically water, in open channels or laboratory setups. It consists of a thin plate with a V-shaped opening through which the water flows.

Principle
The flow rate over a V-notch weir is related to the head (H) of water above the vertex (lowest point) of the notch. The shape of the notch causes the flow to vary with the head in a nonlinear way.

Flow Characteristics
The discharge flows under free-flow conditions (no submergence downstream).

The water surface forms a nappe flowing over the notch.

The flow rate depends on the angle of the V-notch (θ) and the head (H).

Derivation of Discharge Formula
For a V-notch with an angle

θ, the theoretical discharge

Q can be derived by integrating the velocity of flow over the effective flow area at each infinitesimal section of the notch.

Explanation of Terms:
Head (H): The vertical height of the water surface above the vertex of the V-notch.

Coefficient of Discharge (Cd): Accounts for energy losses due to viscosity, turbulence, and flow contraction effects. It is experimentally determined.

 , meaning small changes in head lead to larger changes in flow rate.

V-notch weirs are especially useful for measuring low flow rates because the flow area changes significantly with head.

This method allows accurate flow measurement with minimal equipment.

Assumptions:
Flow is steady and uniform.

No downstream submergence (free flow over the notch).

The flow is incompressible and non-viscous.

Atmospheric pressure acts on the free surface.
