    <h1>V-Notch Flow Rate Experiment - Theory</h1>

    <h2>1. Objective</h2>
    <p>To determine the flow rate of water using a V-notch and compare it with theoretical discharge calculations.</p>

    <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
    <p>A V-notch is a triangular-shaped weir used for measuring small flow rates of liquids in open channels. The discharge over a V-notch depends on the head of liquid above the vertex of the notch. It is more sensitive than a rectangular notch, especially for low flows.</p>

    <h2>3. Principle</h2>
    <p>The V-notch operates on the principle that the discharge is proportional to the head of water raised to the power of 2.5. The shape causes the width of the flow area to increase with height, making it effective for small flows.</p>

    <h2>4. Formula for Discharge</h2>
    <p>The theoretical discharge over a V-notch is given by the formula:</p>
    <p class="formula">Q = (8/15) × Cd × √(2g) × tan(θ/2) × H<sup>5/2</sup></p>

    <h3>Where:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Q</strong> = Discharge (m³/s)</li>
        <li><strong>Cd</strong> = Coefficient of discharge (dimensionless)</li>
        <li><strong>g</strong> = Acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²)</li>
        <li><strong>θ</strong> = Angle of the V-notch (in radians)</li>
        <li><strong>H</strong> = Head of water above the notch vertex (in meters)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Assumptions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flow is steady and free from turbulence.</li>
        <li>The fluid is incompressible.</li>
        <li>The velocity of approach is negligible.</li>
        <li>The head is measured from the vertex of the notch.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Used in labs and field setups to measure small flows in channels.</li>
        <li>Widely used in irrigation, sewage treatment, and environmental monitoring.</li>
    </ul>
