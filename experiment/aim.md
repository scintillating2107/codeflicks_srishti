### Aim of the experiment
To determine the flow rate of water using a V-notch weir and to verify the theoretical relationship between the discharge and the head over the notch.

This experiment helps in:

~ Understanding the principles of flow measurement using notches.

~ Determining the discharge coefficient (𝐶𝑑
​
 ) for a V-notch.

~ Establishing the relationship 
Q ∝ H^5/2
 , where 
𝑄
is discharge and 
𝐻
is the head of water above the notch vertex.
