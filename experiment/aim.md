<h2>Aim</h2>
<p>The primary objective of this experiment is to determine the volumetric flow rate of water through an open channel using a V-notch weir. A V-notch (triangular) weir is a flow measurement structure commonly used in hydraulic laboratories and field conditions for measuring low discharge rates with greater accuracy. The experiment is conducted by allowing water to flow over the V-notch and measuring the height (head) of water above the notch's vertex. Using this measured head, the theoretical flow rate is calculated using the standard discharge equation for a V-notch. Furthermore, the experiment aims to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understand the working principle of a V-notch as a flow measuring device.</li>
  <li>Establish the mathematical relationship between the head of water above the notch and the corresponding discharge.</li>
  <li>Determine the actual discharge by collecting the water over a known time interval and comparing it with the theoretical discharge.</li>
  <li>Calculate the coefficient of discharge (Cd) by comparing actual and theoretical discharges.</li>
  <li>Analyze the accuracy and reliability of the V-notch method for flow measurement in open channel hydraulics.</li>
</ul>
