### The primary objective of this experiment is to determine the volumetric flow rate of water through an open channel using a V-notch weir. A V-notch (triangular) weir is a flow measurement structure commonly used in hydraulic laboratories and field conditions for measuring low discharge rates with greater accuracy. The experiment is conducted by allowing water to flow over the V-notch and measuring the height (head) of water above the notch's vertex. Using this measured head, the theoretical flow rate is calculated using the standard discharge equation for a V-notch.
