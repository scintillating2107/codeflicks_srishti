### Procedure
1. Set up the apparatus:

Ensure the V-notch weir is fixed vertically in the tank.

Fill the supply tank with water and allow it to flow towards the V-notch.

Start the water flow:

Open the inlet valve to allow water to flow over the V-notch.

Wait until the flow becomes steady.

Measure the head (H):

Use a point gauge or scale to measure the vertical distance from the bottom (vertex) of the V-notch to the water surface.

Record this head 
𝐻
H in meters or centimeters.

Collect water to measure actual discharge:

Place a measuring container under the outlet.

Collect water for a known time period (e.g., 30 or 60 seconds).

Measure the volume of water collected.

Calculate actual discharge:
