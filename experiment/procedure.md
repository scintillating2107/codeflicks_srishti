    <strong>Preparation:</strong> Ensure that the experimental setup is clean and all valves are properly connected. The collecting tank must be empty before beginning the experiment.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Initial Setup:</strong> Fill the main supply tank with water, if not already filled. Close the outlet valve of the collecting tank to prevent premature water drainage.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Start the Pump:</strong> Switch on the pump to allow water to flow from the supply tank into the V-notch chamber. Observe the water level rise in the V-notch channel.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Achieve Steady Flow:</strong> Allow the water to flow until a steady-state condition is reached â€” that is, the water level above the notch remains constant for a few moments.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Measure Head over the Notch:</strong> Using the hook gauge or a vertical scale attached near the V-notch, measure the vertical height (H) of the water above the lowest point (vertex) of the V-notch. This height must be noted carefully as it directly affects the flow rate.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Collect Water:</strong> Open the outlet valve of the collecting tank and simultaneously start a stopwatch to begin timing the collection of water. Collect water for a specific and consistent time interval (e.g., 30 seconds or 1 minute).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Stop Collection:</strong> After the set time, close the outlet valve and stop the stopwatch. Ensure no water is added or drained during measurement for accuracy.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Measure Volume Collected:</strong> Record the volume of water collected in the measuring tank using the graduations marked on it, or by manual measurement if needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Repeat for Different Heads:</strong> Adjust the inlet valve to allow a different flow rate, wait for a steady level, and repeat the measurement process multiple times to get a range of data for different heights (H).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Record Observations:</strong> For each trial, note the measured head (H), time of collection (t), and volume collected (V). These values will be used to compute actual and theoretical discharge.
  </li>
