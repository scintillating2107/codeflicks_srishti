<h4> [1. Focus Area](#LO)

  
1. Objective
     To measure and calculate the flow rate of water using a V-notch weir.

     To understand the relationship between head (height of water above notch) and flow rate.

2. Principle
    Based on the application of Bernoulli’s equation and flow measurement through an open channel using a triangular (V-notch) weir.

    The discharge through a V-notch is a function of the head over the notch.

3. Key Concepts
    Open channel flow

    Hydraulics of weirs

    Discharge coefficient (Cd)

    Empirical discharge equation for V-notch weirs

4. Formula Used
    Q = 8/15*Cd*tan(𝜃/2)*(2g)^1/2*H^5/2
    Where:


    Q = Discharge (m³/s)

    𝐶𝑑 = Coefficient of discharge

    𝑔 = Acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²)

    𝜃 = Angle of the V-notch

    𝐻 = Head of water above the notch crest (m)

5. Apparatus
   V-notch weir tank setup

   Measuring scale

   Stopwatch (if measuring over time)

   Collection tank (optional, for volumetric validation)

6. Experimental Procedure (Brief)
   Set up the V-notch weir in the channel.

   Allow water to flow and reach a steady state.

   Measure the head(H) above the notch.

   Calculate theoretical discharge using the formula.

   Optionally, compare with actual discharge using volumetric method.

7. Applications

 
   Used in irrigation channels, wastewater treatment plants, and hydrology studies for accurate flow measurement.


<h4> [2. Learning Objectives ](#LO)

1. Knowledge-Based Objectives
   Understand the principle of flow measurement using a V-notch weir.

   Recognize the relationship between head of water and flow rate in a V-notch weir.

   Identify the different types of notches (e.g., rectangular, triangular/V-notch) and their applications.

2. Skill-Based Objectives
   Accurately set up and operate the V-notch flow measurement apparatus.

   Measure the head over the notch using appropriate instruments (e.g., point gauge or scale).

   Record experimental data systematically and calculate flow rate using standard V-notch formula.

3. Analytical Objectives
   Analyze the relationship between measured head and flow rate.

   Compare experimental flow rate with theoretical values.

   Identify possible sources of error in the measurement and suggest improvements.

4. Application-Based Objectives
   Apply the V-notch method to measure flow in open channels or laboratory settings.

   Use the empirical formula for flow through a V-notch:

   Q = 8/15*Cd*tan(𝜃/2)*(2g)^1/2*H^5/2

   where:

   𝑄 = flow rate,

   𝐶𝑑 = coefficient of discharge,

   𝜃 = notch angle,

   𝐻 = head over the notch,

   𝑔 = acceleration due to gravity.

5. Safety and Best Practice Objectives
   Follow laboratory safety protocols while performing the experiment.

   Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of equipment for accurate results.


<h4> [4. Task & Assessment Questions](#AQ)
✅ Task Overview

  🔧 Task: Determination of Flow Rate Using V-Notch Weir
  Objective:
  To determine the flow rate of water by using a V-notch (triangular notch) weir and verify it with the theoretical formula.

  Apparatus Required:

  V-notch weir tank

  Flow control valve

  Collecting tank

  Stopwatch

  Scale or depth gauge

  Measuring cylinder (optional)

  Theory:
  A V-notch weir is used to measure flow rates in open channels. The discharge 

  Q over a V-notch is given by:

  Q = 8/15*Cd*tan(𝜃/2)*(2g)^1/2*H^5/2
 
  Where:


  Q = Discharge (flow rate)

  𝐶𝑑 = Coefficient of discharge

  𝜃 = Angle of the notch (usually 90°)

  𝑔 = Acceleration due to gravity

  𝐻 = Head of water above the bottom of the notch

✅ Assessment Questions
  A. Conceptual Understanding
  What is the purpose of using a V-notch weir in flow measurement?

  Why is a 90° angle commonly used in V-notch weirs?

  What is the significance of the coefficient of discharge 
  𝐶𝑑 ?

  How does the shape of the notch affect the flow rate measurement?

  Why is the head measured from the bottom of the notch?

  B. Practical Application
  Describe the procedure to measure the head over the V-notch.

  How would you ensure accurate readings during the experiment?

  What are the potential sources of error in this experiment?

  How would you calibrate the weir for higher accuracy?

  How can this method be applied in real-world irrigation or wastewater systems?

  C. Calculation and Analysis
  Derive the formula for discharge over a V-notch.

  If the head over the notch is 0.15 m and the notch angle is 90°, calculate the theoretical discharge assuming 
  𝐶𝑑 = 0.6
  
  Compare the theoretical and actual flow rate obtained. What could explain any differences?

  How does changing the head affect the flow rate in a V-notch weir?

  What is the impact of surface tension and viscosity in small-scale V-notch flow measurements?
