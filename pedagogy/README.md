<h4> [1. Focus Area](#LO)

  
1. Objective
     To measure and calculate the flow rate of water using a V-notch weir.

     To understand the relationship between head (height of water above notch) and flow rate.

2. Principle
    Based on the application of Bernoulli’s equation and flow measurement through an open channel using a triangular (V-notch) weir.

    The discharge through a V-notch is a function of the head over the notch.

3. Key Concepts

4. Formula Used
    Q = 8/15*Cd*tan(𝜃/2)*(2g)^1/2*H^5/2
    Where:


    Q = Discharge (m³/s)

    𝐶𝑑 = Coefficient of discharge

    𝑔 = Acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²)

    𝜃 = Angle of the V-notch

    𝐻 = Head of water above the notch crest (m)

5. Apparatus
   V-notch weir tank setup

   Measuring scale

   Stopwatch (if measuring over time)

   Collection tank (optional, for volumetric validation)

6. Experimental Procedure (Brief)
   Set up the V-notch weir in the channel.

   Allow water to flow and reach a steady state.

   Measure the head(H) above the notch.

   Calculate theoretical discharge using the formula.

   Optionally, compare with actual discharge using volumetric method.

<h4> [5. Simulator Interactions](#SI)
Simulator Interactions for V-Notch Weir Flow Rate Experiment
1. Start the Simulation
Select the V-notch weir experiment from the simulation menu.

Read the theory and objective to understand what parameters will be measured (usually flow rate vs. head).

2. Set Up the Equipment (virtually)
Assemble the water tank, V-notch weir plate, and collection tank if needed.

Place a point gauge or scale at the notch to measure the water head (height above the notch vertex).

3. Input Initial Parameters
Choose the notch angle (typically 60°, 90°, or 120°).

Select flow rate (some simulators let you control it manually or through a valve).

4. Start Flow
Open the valve or start the pump to let water flow over the V-notch.

Wait for steady state (a constant water head).

5. Measure Head (H)
Use the point gauge or simulated scale to measure the height of water above the notch vertex.

Record the value (often in cm or m).

6. Record Flow Rate
In some simulators, flow rate is auto-calculated.

In others, you may need to collect water in a virtual container and measure volume vs. time.
